        <h2>I graduated from Central Washington University in 2011</h2>
        <p>and am currently working in the industry I studied, which is film. 
          8 years later, my parents are <i>still</i> in shock.</p>

      <h3>My body hates Sugar and Dairy, two of nature's greatest offerings.</h3>
      <p>
        I started seeing a naturopath last year, who helped me figure out why I felt 
        like crap all the time: I was accidentally eating things that inflame my cells. 
        As a result, I have an alternative recipe for EVERYTHING (seriously, try me) that 
        doesn't include suagr or dairy. I am a wealth of healthy knowledge!
